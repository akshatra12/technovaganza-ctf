Memory Dump Analysis - Suspicious Process Investigation

I captured a memory dump from a compromised system. The attacker left a backdoor process running that contains a secret message in its memory.

Hex Dump of Process Memory (partial):
45 56 49 4c 5f 50 52 4f 43 45 53 53 5f 53 54 41
52 54 00 54 00 68 00 65 00 5f 00 66 00 6c 00 61
00 67 00 5f 00 69 00 73 00 5f 00 68 00 69 00 64
00 64 00 65 00 6e 00 5f 00 69 00 6e 00 5f 00 6d
00 65 00 6d 00 6f 00 72 00 79 00 5f 00 64 00 75
00 6d 00 70 00 5f 00 61 00 6e 00 61 00 6c 00 79
00 73 00 69 00 73 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Analysis Instructions:
1. Identify the encoding used (look at the pattern of null bytes)
2. Extract the meaningful text from the hex dump
3. The flag is hidden within the recovered text

Technical Notes:
- The process name was "EVIL_PROCESS"
- The secret message is in Unicode/UTF-16 encoding
- Look for patterns between null bytes (00)
- Convert hex to ASCII, ignoring null bytes

Flag Format: Technovaganzactf{recovered_text}
