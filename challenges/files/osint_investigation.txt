üïµÔ∏è OSINT Investigation Challenge

Target: "Alex Chen" - Security Researcher

Background:
Alex Chen is a cybersecurity researcher who recently discovered a major vulnerability.
He mentioned leaving "clues about his findings" in his digital footprint.

Digital Presence to Investigate:

1. Email: alex.chen@cybersec-research.com
2. Twitter: @alexchen_sec (inactive since 2021)
3. GitHub: github.com/alexchen-research
4. Personal Blog: alexchen-security.blogspot.com
5. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/alexchen-cybersec

Known Information:
- He always uses his cat's name as part of his passwords
- His favorite number is 42
- He published a research paper in 2020 about "Web Vulnerabilities"

Your Mission:
Find the secret code he hidden across his digital presence.

Investigation Steps:
1. Check his GitHub repositories for any interesting commits or README files
2. Look at his blog posts from 2019-2020 for hidden messages
3. Analyze his Twitter posts for patterns or coded messages
4. Check if any of his online profiles contain unusual information

Flag Format: Technovaganzactf{found_secret}

Note: This is a simulated investigation. The "secret" is hidden in the way you interpret these clues.
The actual flag is derived from combining: his cat's name + favorite number + research topic.

Example: If cat name is "whiskers", favorite number "42", research "webvuln"
Then flag would be: Technovaganzactf{whiskers42webvuln}
