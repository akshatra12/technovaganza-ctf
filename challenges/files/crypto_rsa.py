üîê RSA Factorization Challenge

In 1977, Ron Rivest said that factoring a 125-digit number would take 40 quadrillion years.
Today, we can do it in seconds. Can you factor this?

RSA Parameters:
n = 1230186684530117755130494958384962720772853569595334792197322452151726400507263657518745202199786469389956474942774063845925192557326303453731548268507917026122142913461670429214311602221240479274737794080665351419597459856902143413
e = 65537
ciphertext = 911285123012386276011855754398791243

Your Mission:
1. Factor n into p and q
2. Calculate the private key d
3. Decrypt the ciphertext

Hint: This number was part of the RSA Factoring Challenge and has been factored before.
The factors are roughly equal in size.
