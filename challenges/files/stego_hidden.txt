üñºÔ∏è Steganography Challenge

I've hidden a secret message in an image using steganography techniques.

Since I can't provide the actual image file, here's what you need to know:

Image Properties:
- Format: PNG
- Size: 800x600 pixels
- Contains: A beautiful landscape photo

Steganography Method:
I used the LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique to hide the message in the RGB values.

The hidden message follows this pattern:
- Every 10th pixel contains 1 bit of the message
- Message is encoded in ASCII
- Starts with "SECRET:" and ends with "END"

To solve this challenge conceptually:
1. Understand how LSB steganography works
2. Extract the LSBs from every 10th pixel
3. Convert the binary to ASCII text
4. The flag is the hidden message

Actual Flag:
Since you can't extract from a real image, the flag represents what you would find:
Technovaganzactf{lsb_steganography_master}

Learning Objective:
This teaches you about LSB steganography. In a real scenario, you would use tools like:
- Stegsolve
- Zsteg
- Python PIL library

Remember: In real CTFs, you would get an actual image file to analyze!
